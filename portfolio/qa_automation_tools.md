## QA Automation Tools Case Study

**Role:** Quality Engineer 

**Project:** Develop an easy to use command line system to automatically check content for spelling, markdown, syntax, or accessibility errors and broken links. 

**Solution:** Using Remark plugins and various linters, I created a package with an easy to use CLI to check both single file 
content and a full repo review for potential issues. This would reduce human error during development and reduce overall review time.
