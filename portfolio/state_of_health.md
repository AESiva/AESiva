## Content in Review

**Role:** Quality Engineer 

**Project:** Conduct a full content review to identify pain points and improvement opportunities.

**Solution:** I took a two-fold approach to this review. I started by identifying user personas and following the customer journey to identify pain points within the user lifecycle. Taking those pain points, I developed improvement opportunities and strategies for implementation. Through this research, I was also able to identify stakeholder pain points and work to implement a streamlined product lifecycle. 
The second part of the review consisted of reviewing KPIs and market research. This gave me a quantitative view of how users were viewing the content. Using this information, I worked with my teams to update the content to improve inclusiveness, accessibility, and market alignment.
