# Network Security for Businesses

### Secure Your Data Through Process Validation 

In 2018, multiple businesses were found to have left personal and/or sensitive data exposed to the public. Twitter admitted to storing unencrypted passwords on an internal log and Exactis, a market research company, left over 340 million person records on a publicly accessible server. Many times these data exposures are the results of software bugs that cause data to be stored in an insecure location or are the result of cloud leaks. The best way to solve this problem is to implement a process validation protocol. A good validation process should be automatic, continuous, and have the ability to take on new process changes. With this process in place, businesses can reduce the risk that data exposure will happen on their side of the equation. Of course, involving a 3rd party host for cloud storage always involves a small risk so businesses should do their research before deciding on which cloud company is best for them.   

### Network Firewalls 

Network firewalls are a critical piece to network security. A network firewall is a security minded router that provides a buffer between the outside world and the network meaning all traffic from the Internet must go through the firewall before reaching the business network. There are two main ways to set up these routers. One, businesses can set up a firewall appliance which is a self-contained router that acts as the security guard to your network. Two, businesses can set up a server computer that acts as the security guard. 
So how do these firewalls work?  There are actually four methods to keep nefarious visitors and packets out of the internal network. Depending on the needs of the network and the sensitivity of the information needing protecting, businesses will need to decide which method will be right for them.  

Packet filtering: this method examines each packet individually as it passes through the router. If it meets the requirements set up by the network administrator, the packet is allowed to pass. If it does not, the packet is rejected. The benefit to this is readily available, is cost efficient and is efficient in its processing. However, it does not look at packets as a whole and can fall victim to. 

Stateful packet inspection: this is the means of examining the packets as they come in in groups rather than individually. This allows the firewall to see the whole picture before making a decision. The only issue with this is that it can sometimes slow packet processing down as the firewall may wait to collect enough information before passing a group of packets along. 
Circuit-level gateway: this method allows secure connections to be established with trusted TCP/IP addresses and port numbers. Once the secure connection is established, packets are allowed to flow freely between the two systems. This speeds up packet sending but can expose the network to issues if a user establishes a connection that isnâ€™t quite aboveboard. 
Application gateway: this method looks at the details of the application that generated the packets. These details help the firewall make intelligent decisions. However, not only are these firewalls more expensive, they can be difficult to configure and maintain.
