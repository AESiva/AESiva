# Cloud Computing and Your Business

By: Ashley Siva

What exactly is cloud computing? It is a buzzword that is tossed around as the greatest thing to happen to digital storage and the worst thing to happen to office efficiency. From a technical side, cloud computing is using a network such as the Internet to provide storage and services to end users. It takes the workload away from local computers and local servers and moves it into the cloud. This can be beneficial to businesses that do not want to set up local servers or store a ton of information on user devices. 

### Who Will Manage the Cloud? 

There are three types of cloud deployment businesses can choose from: public, private and hybrid. The right deployment type for your business will depend on how involved the company wants to be in the management of the infrastructure and services. 
Public deployment: all services and infrastructure are managed by the cloud provider. The end user would access the infrastructure via the Internet. The benefits to public deployment is the cost and limited maintenance. Typically it has lower costs than other deployments and the business does not need a large IT department to maintain it. The downside is security as everything is controlled by the cloud provider. 
Private deployment: services and infrastructure are accessed through a private network. While some companies host their own private cloud on local servers, others pay a third party to host it. The benefit to private deployment is the ability to customize the service and infrastructure to fit the business. The downside is cost and scalability.   
Hybrid deployment: a combination of public and private that allows for more flexibility to the users. The downside to a hybrid deployment is the potential complexity to the infrastructure. 

### What Type of Service Do You Need? 

There are four main categories into which most cloud computing structures fall: IaaS, PaaS, serverless, and SaaS. Many of the cloud computing companies deliver more than one type of these services.
IaaS (infrastructure as a service): allows the user to rent the IT infrastructure and for many cloud servicers, is a pay-as-you-use structure.  
PaaS (platform as a service): deals with the software side of cloud computing. It allows for developing, testing and managing software applications. This service tends to be geared toward more software oriented businesses. 
Serverless: where the cloud manages a server for you. This service type is fairly specific in its capabilities and will not be a popular choice for most non-software oriented businesses. 
Saas (software as a service): focuses on delivering software across the network while handling the infrastructure needed to run it. This service is great for businesses wanting to use applications offered by various companies such as email. 


### Why Make the Move? 

So why are so many businesses moving to cloud computing? From a business point of view, cloud computing is a service that allows a company to store and manage data, use software and conduct business from many different locations without needing local servers or software installed and maintained on each end user device. The biggest benefit to most businesses is the cost. Cloud computing limits the need for local servers. That means more space allocated for other needs, fewer employees needed to manage the servers and lower energy costs. Another benefit is the availability of resources. By utilizing the cloud, businesses can access software and resources almost instantly and scale it easily to fit their business model. However, cloud services come with their downsides. Some will cite performance as a benefit of cloud computing. They will state that server farms that are held by many of these companies offer the latest hardware and firmware to keep a business running at top speed. However, this all depends on the network speed of the company. If a company does not have a solid connection, adequate Internet speed or has insufficient bandwidth, a cloud connection will have problems. As employees attempt to access the resources on the cloud, it can become frustrating and inefficient if connecting is slow or impossible. When time is money, this can be costly. So while cloud computing does have quite a few benefits, anyone thinking of adopting the cloud, should first look to their current infrastructure, resource and storage needs to see if it is the right choice for them. 



Cloud computing is rapidly becoming an indispensable tool for the growing business. For most businesses, cloud computing can save both time and money.  Businesses thinking of moving to the cloud will need to decide what type of service they are looking for and what cloud computing vendor will best fit their needs.
